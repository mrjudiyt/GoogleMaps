# Google Map and Weather REST APIs Project

This project provides REST APIs for displaying a Google map and retrieving weather information for places based on user requirements.

## Overview

This project aims to provide developers with a set of REST APIs to integrate Google Maps and weather data into their applications. With these APIs, developers can easily incorporate map functionality and weather information retrieval according to user preferences.

## Features

- **Google Maps API Integration**: Display interactive Google Maps within your application.
- **Weather Data Retrieval**: Retrieve weather information for specified locations.
- **Customizable User Preferences**: Allow users to specify location, date, and other preferences to tailor the weather data display.

## APIs

### 1. Map Display API

- **Endpoint**: `/api/maps`
- **Description**: Retrieves Google Maps for the specified location.
- **Parameters**:
  - `location` (required): The location for which to display the map.
  - `zoom` (optional): The zoom level for the map.
- **Example**:
  ```
  GET /api/maps?location=Kathmandu&zoom=10
  ```

### 2. Weather Information API

- **Endpoint**: `/api/weather`
- **Description**: Retrieves weather information for the specified location.
- **Parameters**:
